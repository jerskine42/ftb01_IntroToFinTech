## The Importance of Prework

Because of the challenging nature of this program, we want you to come ready to sprint on day one. To help prepare you, we've created these modules to be completed before your first day. The prework will provide you with the preliminary skills and information you need to begin the course. It will also give you a glimpse of what's to come.

We recommend reading the sections in sequential order, as each section builds on the other. You should also complete all assignments, some of which will be fairly challenging and require outside research.

As you work through the readings and assignments, don't be discouraged if some of them give you trouble. Just focus on doing your best.

Good luck, have fun, and get pumped! You are in for an amazing ride.
