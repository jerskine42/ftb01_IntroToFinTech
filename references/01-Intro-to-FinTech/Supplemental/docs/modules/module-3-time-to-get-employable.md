# Module 3: Prepare for the Job Search

Throughout this program, you will work closely with the career team to prepare for the job search upon your completion of the course. 

The goal of the career team can be summed up in a single word: empowerment. They are here to motivate you, offer support, and provide strategies for reaching beyond your comfort zone to find the right opportunity for you. The more information you share, the better equipped our team will be to help in your job search.

## What to Expect on the Job Hunt

When transitioning to a new career, a reasonable timeline for the entire process—from applying for positions to accepting a company's offer—is anywhere from 30 to 90 days. Throughout this program, you will spend time networking and developing a professional narrative to market yourself to employers.

### What You DO Need to Succeed

1. A **professional narrative** that showcases your strengths, skills, and passions.
2. An **ability to showcase your previous skills** and how they add to your value as a technology professional.
3. A **friendly demeanor**—people hire people they like!
4. An **ability to talk about technology**, using technical language.
5. **Practice, practice, practice**. The more interviews and networking events you attend, the more prepared you'll be for your next opportunity.

### What You Do NOT Need to Succeed

1. **Code that looks "perfect."** Remember, no one's code is perfect! As long as it works as expected, you're golden!
2. **Mastering all technologies taught in this course.** You'll learn so much in this boot camp that it'll make your head spin. Remind yourself that you don't need to master everything in only a few weeks. Focus on learning how to teach yourself new technologies via online resources.
3. **Previous experience in FinTech.** If you don't have any prior experience in this field, don't worry! Many companies will let you learn on the job, and they will appreciate the unique perspective and set of skills that you bring to the table.
4. **Every skill listed in the job description.** Job descriptions can be misleading, especially if they are written by someone who is not familiar with technology (as they often are). Apply even if you're unsure whether you fit every requirement in the description. Use your cover letter to showcase your strengths, like your ability to learn quickly. (Your boot camp experience is a great example!)
5. **Certificate of completion from the boot camp.** You don't need a certificate to begin applying to jobs; you can start applying as soon as we've approved your career profile. Don't be afraid to start early! Practice makes perfect, and you'll only get better with each interview.
