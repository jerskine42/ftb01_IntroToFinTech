# Module 8: Ready Set FinTech!

## Google-Fu Tips

As you move forward in your career, you will have questions that you'll often need to find answers for on your own. This is why you need some Google-fu in your life.

Google-fu is a skill in using Google (and other search engines) to find useful information on the internet quickly. Here are a couple of things to keep in mind when googling:

- **Simple is better than complex.** Searches should be simple and broad enough to bring you the anticipated results, e.g., “Python remove key from Dictionary."

- **Focus on keywords.** A search may not always give you the specific answer you're looking for, but it just might point you to a keyword that will help you get there. Therefore, clicking through multiple pages of a search isn't necessarily a waste of time. Pay attention to recurring terms or phrases that can point you in the right direction. These are little gems that will lead you to the mine.
